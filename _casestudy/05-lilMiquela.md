[Lil Miquela](https://www.instagram.com/lilmiquela/) is a Instagram virtual influencer created by the Los Angeles based companie Brud and later absorbed into Dapper Labs. She is one of the more complex cases we have analyzed, presented as a 19-year-old Brazilian-American model and musician, with over 3 million followers and brand collaborations with Prada, Calvin Klein, and Chanel. Her existence reveals how coporated engineered femininity becomes a place for both emotional engagement and the reproduction of real world misogyny. Notably, her design has a slightly generic aesthetic what seems to be a calculated choice to enhance relatability. She also shows an imperfect CGI render that evokes the "uncanny valley" feeling when looking at her posts, this is not explicit if it is intensional or not, maybe it is just a lack of technology development. Unlike many virtual influencers, her profile does not explicitly disclose her artificiality, allowing the narrative of her authenticity to take precedence.

## Narrative and Authenticity

Miquela’s creators have constructed her identity as a continuous serialized drama. Her musical career, political activism, such as posts aligned with #BlackLivesMatter, and curated relationships with other virtual personas form a coherent narrative designed to simulate a a real person. This is not merely an aesthetic choice but a strategy to foster deep parasocial bonds. The objective is the commodification of authenticity itself, where relatability and vulnerability become manufactured resources to make audience become invested and generate profit for brands.

The ethical boundaries of this creation were already severely tested. In 2019, Miquela released a video with a claim of sexual assault, adopting a trauma narrative for brand development and creating debate about exploitative appropriation (Schmithorst, 2023). This pattern continued in March 2025, when Miquela disclosed a leukemia diagnosis in a sponsored partnership with the bone marrow donation nonprofit NMDP. Accompanying videos featured "conversations" with medical professionals and a collaboration with influencer JoJo Siwa, who joined the donor registry after seeing the posts. While disclaimers noted Miquela’s non-human status and the dramatization of symptoms, the campaign leveraged the semiotics of intimate human suffering to drive engagement for a cause, further blurring the line between narrative empathy and commercial or advocacy strategy.

## Coded Femininity and the Pipeline of Harm

Despite her artificial nature, Lil Miquela’s social media channels are frequent targets of intense harassment, bullying, and gendered hostility. This abuse ranges from sexualized objectification of her CGI form to attacks on her character, with comments such as "burn in hell." This phenomenon demonstrates how patterns of digital misogyny and patriarchal policing are projected onto virtual, female-coded entities (Schmithorst, 2023). The abuse is not mitigated by her artificiality but is evoked by her performed femininity.

When a persona is constructed as female through visual cues, vocal patterns, and narrative tropes, it becomes a receptacle for pre-existing cultural misogyny. The violence is directed not at a biological woman but at the sign of woman, showing that symbolic representation alone is sufficient to trigger social patterns of discipline and hostility. The public's anger, while understandable given controversial narrative choices, is misdirected at the avatar rather than its human creators, revealing a fascinating dislocation of agency and blame.

## Social Bias

Lil Miquela’s case exemplify the concept of a feedback loop. She is a corporate product designed to optimize engagement through the simulation of human complexity, yet she simultaneously becomes a mirror reflecting cultural pathologies. Her existence and the issues it has being through show that even a perfectly controlled, corporate owned performance of femininity cannot escape the gendered abuse. This reveals how biases present our society shape the datasets and design choices.

Miquela’s commercial success and her status as a victim of harassment are not contradictory but are actually connected. Her effectiveness as a marketing instrument relies on creating a convincing simulation of a relatable female subject, a simulation that, by its very success, attracts the same patriarchal mechanisms that pressure human women. In this sense, the virtual influencer does not transcend social reality; instead, she becomes a new place where old power dynamics are rehearsed and reinforced
