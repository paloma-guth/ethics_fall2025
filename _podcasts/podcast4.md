### By Paloma and Omar

In this episode, the podcast explores two original Black Mirror-inspired story concepts that imagine near-future technologies and their ethical consequences. For our episode ideas, we drew inspiration from The Three-Body Problem, Ready Player One, and our class discussions on technology and society. We discuss themes of simulation, engineered escapism, and moral responsibility.

The first episode idea is about a group of students living in a post-class utopia who discover their software is being used to justify violence against outcasts, while the second focus on a virtual reality platform that promises emotional balance but leaves users detached from real life. These stories led us to reflect on empathy, social control, and the limits of technological progress.
