### Who might benefit and who might be affected

- **Tech Companies & Creative Agencies**: These stakeholders are the primary creators and IP holders, positioning themselves at the forefront of digital "innovation." They profit directly from the creation, licensing, and management of virtual personas. The primary benefit is the development of a new, highly controllable asset class for the attention economy. However, they also have significant risk, including ethical backlash, public controversy over representation, and potential reputational damage if their creations are seen as perpetuating harmful stereotypes or exploitative practices.

- **Brands & Advertisers:** This group uses virtual influencers for market efficiency and brand safety. Benefits include predictable marketing campaigns, freedom from personal scandals of human influencers, and the ability to commission a perfectly persona tailored to a specific demographic. The primary risk is association with unethical practices, such as the reinforcement of unrealistic beauty standards or the digital appropriation of marginalized identities, which can lead to consumer boycotts.

- **Consumers & Followers:** As the audience, consumers drive the economic viability of virtual influencers. Since it is still possible to identify non human personas at this time, engagement is primarily driven by curiosity and novelty, which can evolve into sustained parasocial relationships that offers entertainment and a sense of community. The risks, however, are one of the most harmful. These include negative impacts on self-esteem and body image through comparison with algorithmic perfection, emotional manipulation via engineered intimacy, and the reinforcement of social biases through stereotypical or appropriative digital representations. This contributes to a form of digital colonization, where identity is reshaped by corporate, algorithmic interests.

- **Human Influencers & Models:** This stakeholders faces direct economic and professional displacement. Virtual influencers create pressure to match an unattainable, digitally perfected standard and introduce new competition in the influencer marketplace. The primary risk is job loss and devaluation of human labor, as brands may opt for cheaper, more compliant digital alternatives, raising critical questions about the future of creative and modeling professions.

- **Regulators & Policymakers:** Currently a largely absent stakeholder, their role is becoming increasingly urgent. They are the ones tasked with protecting the public interest but are always behind technological development. Key areas requiring intervention include protecting minors from manipulative marketing and unrealistic body standards, ensuring transparency in advertising (e.g., clear labeling of AI-generated content), and developing frameworks for fair competition and intellectual property in the digital persona economy. The current regulatory lack represents a significant risk to all other stakeholders, allowing potential harms to scale without oversight.
