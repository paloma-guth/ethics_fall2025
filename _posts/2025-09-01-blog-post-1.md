Thoughts and discussions on how individual rights to ownership and creativity can be overwritten by tech companies in the pursuit of technological development, often justified under the claim of “fair use.”

**Case Study reading:**  
[AI guzzled millions of books without permission. Authors are fighting back](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/07/19/ai-books-authors-congress-courts/)

Why this matters?
---
The issue raised in the article highlights the increasing need for stronger regulation in the development of technology. Today, large tech companies operate with little supervision, which blurs the boundaries of what they are allowed to do, and this can often end up harming individual rights.

The article specifically discusses how companies like OpenAI and Microsoft have used copyrighted material to train large language models without acknowledgement or compensation for authors and publishers. This reminded me of the [Aaron Swartz case](https://www.npr.org/2013/01/15/169421636/did-prosecutors-go-too-far-in-swartz-case), a young computer activist who faced 13 federal felony charges for downloading 40 million academic journals from JSTOR. While Swartz’s actions technically involved hacking MIT’s systems, the act of downloading the articles in itself was not explicitly illegal. Yet, he was subjected to an overwhelming prosecution and eventually took his own life.

The contrast is baffling: one individual was seriously punished for accessing less than a terabyte of academic articles, while corporations like [Meta can download over 80 terabytes of copyrighted books and articles from LibGen](https://cybernews.com/tech/meta-leeched-82-terabytes-of-pirated-books-to-train-its-llama-ai-documents-reveal/) and face no consequences. Instead, they justify their actions as “fair use.” Meanwhile, the public has little transparency about how this data is actually used.

Ethical Concerns
----
These cases raise significant ethical questions:
- How much freedom should corporations have simply because they can afford it?
- Where do we draw the line between advancing technology for the greater good and protecting the rights of individuals whose work greatly contributes to that progress?
- What kinds of ethical biases are in the works used to train AI models, and how do these biases shape the outputs of chatbots and other tools?
