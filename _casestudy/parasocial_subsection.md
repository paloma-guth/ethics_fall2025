## Parasocial Relationships and Emotional Manipulation

Virtual influencers do more than just look perfect, they create a sense of connection with their audience, even though that connection is one-sided. Parasocial theory (Bowlby, 1982) explains how people can feel emotionally attached to media figures without any real interaction. On platforms like Instagram, followers of virtual influencers like Lil Miquela, Imma, and Lucy often feel like they “know” these personas, they follow their updates, comment on their posts, and engage with their lives as if they were real people (Bond, 2019).

This sense of closeness is intentional. These AI personas are designed to have stories, opinions, and identifiable traits that make them relatable. (something - examples like Lil Miquela and the SA story scandal). All of this makes them feel authentic and socially aware, even though every detail is curated or controlled by a creator or algorithm.
Parasocial relationships can be especially strong with younger audiences who spend hours scrolling social media, liking posts, and sharing content (Djafarova & Bowes, 2021; Priporas et al., 2017). The problem is that this kind of engagement can make comparisons inevitable. Virtual influencers are flawless, they never age, make mistakes, or deal with real-life problems, which can intensify body dissatisfaction and pressure to live up to impossible beauty standards (Coy-Dibley, 2016; Wolf, 1991).
Parasocial relationships with AI influencers show how technology can blur the line between connection and manipulation. They highlight how audiences crave relatability and emotional engagement, but also how these connections can influence self-image and ideas of femininity in powerful ways.
