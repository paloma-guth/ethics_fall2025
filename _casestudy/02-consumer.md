## Digitalized Feminity

Imagine you are just scrolling through Instagram or any other social media after a tiring day at work or at school and you find a new person: flawless skin, perfect outfit, living a life that looks like a dream. You feel that familiar feeling, a mix of envy and insecurity. Then you spot the tiny hashtag, hidden under many other tags: `VirtualInfluencer`. She's not real. Just code and clever marketing.

So why do you still feel like you don’t measure up? You know she is not real, but she should be based on something right? But what you don’t know is that intentionally or not, her reference for creation is biased.

Welcome to the new world of AI influencers. They are not just digital art; they are marketing machines designed to be perfect, relatable, and impossible to ignore. We are used to this topics being discussed in tech jargons, being of difficult access to others, but this is a really issue, this is a social issue and not just a tech one anymore. This discussion is about how these perfectly engineered digital personas are reshaping your self-image, your wallet, and your sense of what is real.

## **The Illusion: Why They Feel Real**

AI influencers are not people, but they are designed to feel like it. They have personalities written for them, curated aesthetics, and daily posts just like any other creator you might follow. They do brand deals. They travel. They even open up about personal struggles. All of this is designed, scripted. As humans, we are wired to react to patterns, consistency, and relatability, not to question whether something is human or generated.

If you have spent time online, you have probably seen edited photos, filters, or even VTubers, digital avatars with real people behind the screen. Those are still fully created by a human, their creativity and personality. AI influencers are different. They’re built from scratch, fine tuned to fit certain beauty ideals or trends. 

It’s deception in a subtle way. AI influencers blend into the exact same digital space where real people share their lives. They mimic the familiar vibe of social media with selfies, updates, and stories, until we stops actively checking what’s real and what’s scripted. The more seamlessly they resemble us, the more influence they gain.

## **The Comparison Game**

We've long known that Photoshopped magazine models set unrealistic standards. But AI influencers take this to a terrifying new level. They don't just enhance reality; they replace it.

Have you seen these people? What do you think of them?

Even if we still feel a bit uneasy because they don’t seem human enough, that’s just a matter of technological development. Soon, we won’t be able to tell the difference. An AI influencer's skin is programmed to be poreless, perfect. A human ages. An AI is forever young. A human can only be in one place at a time. An AI can be "seen" in Tokyo, Paris, and a music festival all in the same hour.

Psychologists call this digitized dysmorphia, the anxiety and negative self-image that comes from comparing yourself to a digital ideal that no human can ever achieve. It’s like running a race where the finish line is a hologram, an illusion. You'll never win, but you'll exhaust yourself trying.

> *"They don’t have bad skin days or cellulite or hair that won’t cooperate… they exist in a state of perpetual idealization."* — Vox

When your feed is filled with these impossible standards, it’s not a surprise to feel lacking. The problem isn't you; it's being measured against a fiction. We need to ask why we fell like that and who is benefiting from it. 

## **The Fake Friend Feeling: How They Build "Trust" to Sell**

Ever feel like you kind know the influencers you follow? How about is that influencer is an AI? Would you still know them? That's not an accident. It's a psychological strategy called a parasocial relationship, a one-sided connection you feel with a media figure.

Brands use this to build trust. An AI influencer might share a vulnerable story about a breakup or post about social justice causes you care about. They use casual language, as if they’re talking with a friend. In the images above, we can see that only Shudu uses hashtags indicating she isn’t real. Lil Miquela, on the other hand, has been involved in multiple controversies before, including sharing fake abuse stories. In the above caption, she mentions having creative block, as if she were a person and not code. Again trying to create a personal connection with the followers

This makes them feel authentic and relatable. But it’s a script. The goal is to make you lower your guard, so when they tag a $300 sweater, it feels like a recommendation from a friend, not an ad from a corporation. You're forming an emotional bond with a salesperson who doesn't exist.

There is also the cute side of it. We humans are drawn to cuteness because it signals vulnerability, harmlessness, and something that needs protection. Big eyes, soft features, pastel colors are traits that trigger care instincts we usually associate with children or small animals. Imma is an example of this aesthetic, having soft features, gentle expressions, and an overall non threatening presence. This carefully engineered cuteness makes her feel safe and likable, lowering our defenses and making emotional attachment feel natural.

## **What You Can Do: Take Back Your Feed**

This all sounds depressing, but we still have autonomy and should fight back. Becoming a critical consumer is your best defense.
### **1. Be a Detective**
- **Look for the tags:** Scan bios and captions for `#VirtualInfluencer`, `#CGI`, or `#AI`.
- **Ask questions:** Who created this account? What company owns it?
### **2. Talk About It**
- Discuss this with your friends. Awareness breaks the illusion.
- Support creators and activists pushing for clearer labeling rules for AI-generated content.
### **3. Remember the Truth**
- **Perfection is a product.** It’s literally being sold to you.
- **Your worth is not a metric.** Likes, shares, and a “perfect” appearance are not measures of your value.
- **Being human is beautiful.** Your “flaws” (laugh lines, unique proportions, a changing body) are signs of a life lived. They’re things no algorithm can truly replicate or understand.

This doesn’t mean you can’t follow them or engage with their content, just know the truth, they are not real. You are more than a consumer to be targeted. You are a person, not a profile. In a world filling up with perfect digital ghosts, your real, messy, human self is not only enough, it's revolutionary.
