### Superlatives

Blog: [BIAS Blog 1: Right to Fair Representation](https://paloma-guth.github.io/ethics_fall2025/posts/2025/21/blog-post-7/)<br>
*Superlative:* Most engaging

This was the post where I had the most to say, not just academically, but personally. Coming from a culture that is constantly reduced to one stereotype, I see every day how representation shapes not only perception, but also economic outcomes. Writing this blog felt like writing about real life, not just a prompt. I could connect theory to the world I live in.

Blog: [SOC Blog 2: Implications of a Tech-Focused Society](https://paloma-guth.github.io/ethics_fall2025/posts/2025/10/blog-post-6/)<br>
*Superlative:* Most frustrating

Not because the topic was boring, far from it. Mining, e-waste, and exploitation are a well known topic, as far as I know, yet nobody seems to do anything about it. Writing this post made me realize how much I rely on sources, probably because people often don’t believe me when I speak from experience. As an international student, you get used to citing everything so people stop assuming you “made it up.”

### Blog evolution

I didn’t have one blog that required a major rewrite. For Blog 1: Ethical Frameworks I had to write more about what matters to me, even though what matters to me is deeply political and social, not hobbies, not personal tastes, but the structures that shape my life. Any revisions I made tended to be about structure, not ideas.

Understanding my writing process

### Writing skills and growth

I don’t love writing in the first person. I know my views can be strong and controversial, so distancing myself from it feels safer, people take it more seriously when it isn’t framed as just my opinion. Still, I learned I can write more personally when needed. Honestly, the feedback, not the writing itself, made me have another perspective. It made me think about how others interpret what I say.

What matters to me isn’t hobbies or personal anecdotes—it’s the things that shape everyday life for me and for people like me. Seeing how others approached the same topics differently was actually really important.

### Writing style

I think blogs are better for this course. I felt more freedom to actually engage with the ideas instead of just comparing articles. Even though I still cited sources (force of habit), I wrote what I genuinely thought. I do not think I wrote for an online audience as intended but more for myself. If I were writing for a real public audience, I would’ve filtered myself a lot more. This version was closer to honesty than performance.

### Patterns and habits

I cite a lot, partly because I assume people will not believe what I say, and partly because I don’t trust information online either. I am openly critical of capitalism, and throughout the semester I became more confident saying that since no one penalized me for it. I tend to base opinions on material realities because that’s how I learned to justify what I think to people who don’t understand my context.

Course Content

### Topics and themes

I enjoyed writing about privacy the most. I wish we did more with it, but I understand that the foundation had to come first. When I learned someone could deepfake you with just images from different angles, I deleted almost everything online. So privacy isn’t abstract for me, it’s self-protection. If I could, I would disappear into the woods with no technology at all. Have you heard of [anarcho-primitivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-primitivism)? I’m really close to agreeing with everything they say.

I wish we talked more about how anonymity is disappearing, and the politics around that. I do have contradictory opinions about this topic: I want anonymity because I enjoy existing online without worrying that people I know will judge my opinions, but I also recognize the risks of a lawless digital space.

The prompts and discussion questions on the articles worked fine, but maybe adding “How does this affect your life?” as an extra would have maybe made people better understand that everything is connected. Even if something doesn’t affect you now, it eventually will and I am not sure if people understand that. We all have watched at least one tv show where society becomes interstellar, like [The 100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_100_(TV_series)), but we forget who actually gets left behind. We won’t be on the spaceship, we’ll be on the hellish earth dealing with the consequences.

### Knowledge integration

To be honest, nothing actually“clicked.” Most of these issues are already obvious if you live in societies shaped by racism, classism, and politics, which we all do. Technology isn’t some neutral, magical force floating above reality, it just reproduces what already exists. Tech isn’t a utopia, it’s a mirror, a dystopian one. The only new pieces were the specific case studies, like the shotspotters, that of course were placed in poor neighborhoods, but the themes were not surprising.

Looking Forward

### Future use of this website

I will be deleting this website site as soon as classes end and my grades are in. We already live in a surveillance age, and I know these posts become part of my digital footprint. If I ever end up in political trouble, which isn’t unlikely, considering I’m not someone who stays quiet and I participate in protests and associations, this content could be dug up and used against me. But for now hiding it behind a non-public layer is enough. My political opinions are not employable, and survival requires compliance with a system I fundamentally disagree with.

### Future writing identity

I don’t see myself as a writer outside class. I like thinking and talking, but not leaving written evidence. If anything, maybe storytelling for D&D, because, as we all know, campaigns are political anyway.

### Personal writing goals

Honestly, I wouldn’t be setting a writing goal. I like reading far more than writing. I do have a loose plan to escape the brain-rot cycle by doing some creative writing, on paper, offline, maybe building a fantasy world someday (possibly the start of a D&D setting). But the moment it turns into an obligation, it becomes another productivity task. For me this aligns too much with capitalist alienation: you stop being a person and become a producer. I don’t want my thoughts or opinions to become one more thing that can be packaged, consumed, or scraped as data. Writing should be enjoyable, not production, and if it stops feeling that way, I’d rather not do it at all.
