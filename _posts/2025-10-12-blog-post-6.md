**The Price of Progress**<br>
The hidden human and environmental costs of the electronics we consume.

**Case Study:**  
[From Mining to E-waste: The Environmental and Climate Justice Implications of the Electronics Hardware Life Cycle](https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/pub/w9ht6hue/release/5?readingCollection=ca73f7c0)

Introduction
---
This case study explores the environmental and social impacts of electronics production, from mining to e-waste, highlighting how the Global South bears the costs of resources and labor for technologies consumed in the Global North. It examines the tension between climate goals, economic development, and justice, questioning what true sustainability looks like.

Questions and Discussion
---
### 1. Mining and climate justice, can they coexist?

There’s a considerable tension between mining and climate justice, and I don’t think they can coexist anymore. Mining has always been associated with industrialisation for developing economies and yes, we’ve seen what that development can create: computers, satellites, medical advances, and tools that can even help find cures for diseases. But at what cost? Mining causes deforestation, forest fires, emissions, and violence against Indigenous and rural communities in the Global South, the same regions that hold most of the world’s mineral reserves.

How can there be justice when the companies that make use of these materials aren’t even from the countries being destroyed? Most of the gold mined in Brazil ends up in foreign countries, some even through [illegal routes](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2025-02-20/stonex-bought-illicit-gold-from-the-amazon-rainforest). Same with cobalt in Ghana. The people doing the work don’t get richer; they get sick, they lose their land, and they die young.

Now there is a global race for rare earth minerals. As [one study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214790X24001060#sec0003) put it, “Green technological developments enhance environmental well-being and reduce emissions in the Global North, yet the CMs on which these depend are predominantly extracted and processed in marginalised areas of the Global South”. These are what they call green sacrifices, the price others pay so that the Global North can feel good about sustainable progress.

So no, I don’t think mining and climate justice can coexist. We’ve already crossed that line. We already have enough minerals sitting in landfills and old devices, waiting to be recycled. But it’s cheaper for companies to keep digging new holes. Maybe [scarcity will finally force a change](https://tdcventures.com/the-real-cost-of-virgin-metals-vs-recycled-metals-in-a-resource-constrained-world), but by then, it might be too late.

### 2. Do the potential benefits of  “green” technology in mitigating climate outweigh the costs to local communities and environments? 

They say mining is necessary for green technology, but what’s the point of those benefits if the people most affected won’t live long enough to see them? The [Yanomami indigenous community](https://e360.yale.edu/features/brazil-yanomami-mining-malaria-malnutrition-lula) is being poisoned. [Rivers are toxic](https://apnews.com/article/brazil-indigenous-amazon-mining-cop30-vale-xikrin-9f8643135fad5fbcfe6092b1dec00304). Forests are gone.

The supposed benefits for climate mitigation are a promise for some distant future and by the time we reach that future, the problem may have grown so much that our carefully designed solutions might not work anymore. We’re trying to fix a fire by adding more fuel to it.

Even what’s sold as good development often ends up fueling destruction. Starlink was supposed to connect rural communities, but in Brazil it’s being used by [illegal miners in the Amazon to coordinate and expand their operations](https://www.mining.com/elon-musks-starlink-linked-to-illegal-mining-in-brazil/). 

If we actually recycled what we already have, maybe “green” technology would finally be green. The materials we need already exist, buried in mountains of discarded devices. But even recycling has to be done carefully, exporting this waste to undeveloped countries just creates another layer of harm. The same people who suffer from mining end up suffering again from toxic recycling. It’s a cycle that keeps the Global South stuck cleaning up the mess made by the Global North. Until that changes, nothing about this system can truly be called sustainable.

### 3. To what extent do you think governments and electronics companies should prioritize cost, timeliness, and justice when it comes to which CE policies they choose to implement?

Most circular economy policies focus on what’s cheap and fast. Justice-centered policies are the ones that actually protect people and might have a real impact, since they are deeply connected to how things are produced. But those are slower and more expensive, which is exactly why companies avoid them.

Governments shouldn’t let corporations decide what counts as sustainability, because they will always choose what benefits them most. That’s why we need laws that make justice non-optional. Measuring impact through LCA and S-LCA, as mentioned in the article, is useful, but it only matters if there’s real accountability.

Companies and governments should start with what can be done quickly but don’t use that as an excuse to ignore the people being harmed in the process. Recycling and renewables mean nothing if the workers handling waste are still getting sick, or if Indigenous land is still being taken. Justice shouldn’t be the last step; it should be built into the design.

### 4. What might pose challenges to the proposed solutions to the issues surrounding e-waste? Why might certain stakeholders oppose any of the solutions?

Fixing the e-waste problem is hard because the system is designed to keep it broken. Products are made with planned obsolescence, so people keep buying new ones. There’s also the social pressure of always needing the latest thing, even when the updates barely change anything. 

At the same time, these companies fight against the right to repair. They want full control over what you can and can’t do with what you own. People who jailbreak their devices are treated like criminals just for trying to actually own what they bought. 
There’s also the issue of informal recyclers. Many people in the Global South depend on e-waste for economic survival. Some might resist stricter recycling systems because they’re afraid of losing their only source of income.

Meanwhile, corporations oppose changes because it would cost them money. Right now, they export their waste to underdeveloped countries, if they had to handle it on the source, they’d lose profit. 

### 5. How do the climate justice implications of e-waste relate to other social justice issues in the Global South?

Everything is connected. Mining, manufacturing, e-waste; it’s all part of the same chain of exploitation. The Global South provides the materials, the cheap labor, and then becomes the dumping ground for the waste. People in those places breathe in poison so others can have new gadgets every year.

This isn’t an accident, it’s how the system was built. It’s the same colonial logic, just with new names. The periphery produces; the center consumes. And when the periphery tries to protect itself, there are sanctions, trade threats, or coups. It’s all tied together: climate injustice, economic exploitation, and colonial legacies.

New Question
---
How do our everyday choices as consumers, such as buying new devices, not trying to fix what is broken and always trying to upgrade to the newest model, contribute to the cycle of exploitation in the Global South, and what responsibilities do we have as individuals?

*Explanation*<br>
It is easy to critique the system but always put yourself outside of it as you are not part of the system, but we all are. The case study highlights systemic injustices in mining, manufacturing, and e-waste, but it can be easy to think of these as distant problems. By asking people to reflect on their own consumption habits, this question encourages us all to consider how their actions are connected to larger systems of injustice.

Reflection
----
I think we need to pause for a moment and really think about where we’re going. We went to the Moon with the technology we already had, we don’t need another billion-dollar device to survive. I like the access and comfort that technology gives, but sometimes I wonder what we’ve traded for it. What’s the meaning of progress if it keeps costing people and places their lives? What’s the good of profit when there’s no one left to buy?

It’s strange how easily we’ve accepted all this as normal. The fires, the floods, the waste. Maybe that’s what scares me the most, how used to it we’ve become. Companies keep building devices that we can’t even repair ourselves. And if we try, it becomes a violation, a “jailbreak,” as if fixing what we own is some kind of rebellion.

Sometimes I wonder if the real problem isn’t the technology itself, but the way we relate to it, how much power we’ve given it, and how little control we still have. Maybe we need to slow down, not to reject progress, but to finally understand what it’s doing to us, and who it’s leaving behind.
