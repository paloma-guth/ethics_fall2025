## Abstract

The rise of AI-generated personas in social media and digital culture has changed the ways in which gender is represented and consumed. Female coded AI systems, from virtual assistants like Siri to hyperreal social media influencers such as Lil Miquela, Imma, Lucy, and Shudu, tend to attract higher engagement, commercial attention, serving as tools for brands to increase profit. Companies deliberately design these personas to meet brand objectives, often perpetuating narrow ideals of femininity while reinforcing pre-existing social and cultural biases. This phenomenon raises fundamental questions: can gender be programmed without perpetuating stereotypes, and what impact does this have on the self-perception and identity of audiences, particularly younger consumers?

Unlike earlier forms of digital ideation of beauty, which relied on Photoshop, filters, and cosmetic enhancements, AI influencers present a level of hyperrealism previously unattainable. Virtual influencers are not simply visual avatars; they are meticulously crafted digital beings with narratives, personalities, and social presence, designed to evoke engagement and emotional attachment. As these figures grow more ubiquitous, understanding their influence on gender norms, body image, and social perception becomes critical to try to mitigate their potential negative effects on younger generations.
This case study examines how AI systems encode and perform femininity, exploring the sociological, psychological, and ethical implications of these digital personas. It focuses on the mechanisms of gender coding in AI, the commercialization of femininity through virtual influencers, the resulting effects on self-image, and contrasts between human-mediated and autonomous AI performances of gender.

## Introduction

## Discussion

### Coded Femininity
AI systems learn to reproduce gendered traits primarily through large datasets that reflect societal biases. Open-source large language models, for instance, frequently assign men to high-status professions, such as engineers or doctors, while relegating women to undervalued roles, such as domestic servants or cooks (UNESCO, 2023). These outputs highlight the ways in which AI replicates existing gender hierarchies and stereotypes present in training data.

Gender, from a sociological perspective, is not a binary, fixed category; it is fluid, socially constructed, and context-dependent. Yet, AI systems simplify this complexity into discrete categories, often reinforcing western notions of femininity and masculinity. This is exemplified in virtual assistants such as Siri, Alexa, and Cortana, which predominantly use female voices. Users unconsciously associate these voices with compliance, helpfulness, and non-confrontational behavior, reinforcing traditional gender roles in both perception and interaction. By codifying gendered behavior and aesthetics, AI becomes both a mirror and amplifier of societal expectations (Croes & Bartels, 2021; Schouten et al., 2020).

### The Influencer Industry
The commercialization of digital femininity is most visible in the rise of hyperreal virtual influencers. Figures like Lil Miquela, Shudu, Imma, and Lucy merge human aesthetics with algorithmic control, offering brands an unprecedented degree of predictability, malleability, and brand safety (Moustakas et al., 2020). Lil Miquela, with over three million Instagram followers, blends fashion influence, music, and social advocacy, cultivating a highly curated persona that engages audiences while avoiding the risks inherent in human influencers’ real-life behaviors. Similarly, Imma, as the virtual ambassador for Magnum, participates in marketing campaigns designed to resonate with young consumers’ desire for trendy and aspirational experiences (Dabiran et al., 2022).

The creation of these personas often, or ideally should, involve considerations of race, culture, and identity. For example, Shudu, a black AI influencer designed by a British man, can be seen as a white man’s digital projection of black womanhood, raising questions about authenticity and the ethics of representing identities that differ from those of the creator. By embodying idealized standards of beauty, such as flawless skin, symmetrical features, and youthful appearance, virtual influencers reinforce a singular vision of femininity aligned with commercial objectives, often reflecting the male gaze and globalized beauty norms (Jackson, 2018; Wolf, 1991).

Virtual influencers extend beyond visual appeal; they construct narrative identities that engage with socio-political discourse, popular culture, and lifestyle trends. Miquela was seen openly supports social movements like #BlackLivesMatter, even adding the hashtag to her Instagram bio, while Kyra, Imma, and Rozy use pride flags and pronouns to signal inclusivity and awareness of gender identity. These curated interactions foster parasocial relationships, wherein followers feel intimately connected to influencers, despite their fictional or algorithmic nature (Bowlby, 1982; Bond, 2019).

#### Parasocial Relationships and Emotional Manipulation

Virtual influencers do more than just look perfect, they create a sense of connection with their audience, even though that connection is one-sided. Parasocial theory (Bowlby, 1982) explains how people can feel emotionally attached to media figures without any real interaction. On platforms like Instagram, followers of virtual influencers like Lil Miquela, Imma, and Lucy often feel like they “know” these personas, they follow their updates, comment on their posts, and engage with their lives as if they were real people (Bond, 2019).

### Impact on Self-Image
The hyperreal aesthetics and curated narratives of AI influencers have serious implications on body image, self-esteem, and psychological well-being. Virtual influencers are designed with idealized, youthful, and symmetrical features, often surpassing the limitations of human appearance. Research shows that such portrayals can exacerbate body dissatisfaction and create a sense of “digitized dysmorphia,”(search more about this topic) wherein individuals measure themselves against unattainable digital standards (Coy-Dibley, 2016; Huang et al., 2020).

The highly controlled nature of these personas allows them to avoid negative behaviors that human influencers might exhibit, further amplifying their perception of perfection. For female audiences in particular, repeated exposure to these idealized images, amplified by social media algorithms, can intensify feelings of inadequacy and anxiety (Fardouly & Vartanian, 2016; Meier & Gray, 2013). These effects mirror the long-standing feminist critiques of beauty culture as a mechanism of control, commodification, and surveillance of women’s bodies (Wolf, 1991). (I got this from some articles so need to rewrite + get more references)

Virtual influencers also experience similar forms of online harassment as real women, demonstrating that digital femininity can attract misogyny, objectification, and gendered scrutiny. 
Baudrillard’s notion of the simulacrum is particularly apt when considering these hyper‑real digital influencers. He argues that in a world of simulation, the “map precedes the territory”, the image or sign comes before and generates what is taken to be real. In the case of virtual influencers like Lil Miquela or Shudu, the flawless, idealised body and persona do not simply imitate an existing real woman model; rather they construct a new “femininity” that becomes the reference point for both brands and followers. In effect, the influencer is less a representation of a woman and more a simulacrum of femininity itself, divorcing the image from any underlying “real” body. This helps explain why exposure to such influencers might increase self‑image anxieties: the standard being held up is not an attainable human body, but a model of perfection that precedes and shapes what users interpret as “real”. → digital personas are idealised, controlled, and predictable — which aligns with his idea of simulation replacing representation.

### The VTuber Contrast
Human-mediated VTubers and AI-driven figures like NeuroSama offer contrasting performances of gender. VTubers, controlled by humans, perform gender consciously, shaping narratives that reflect personal identity, creativity, and cultural engagement. In contrast, AI-driven VTubers execute algorithmically generated behaviors and personas, potentially codifying and amplifying existing gender stereotypes.

This shows the growing cultural significance of digitally mediated femininity and the ways in which gender can be deliberately designed, performed, and consumed in digital spaces (Marwick, 2013; Senft, 2012).
