**When data becomes law**<br>
The societal consequences of making digital systems compulsory.

The datafied State
---
A few years ago, the Databites channel hosted a conversation called Conversations on the Datafied State: Race, Surveillance, and Resistance. The panel, featuring Chaz Arnett, Alyx Goodman, Raul Carillo, and Tamara Nooper, with Laura Guzman and Rigo being the organizers, brought together voices from different perspectives mostly activism, community work, and technology to ask an important question: What happens when governments mandate digital systems as the default way of organizing society?

Who and What
---
The speakers focused on how technologies like [ShotSpotter](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/24/us/shotspotter-cities-choose-not-to-use) (a gunshot detection system placed disproportionately in poor neighborhoods) and databases tracking gang members are far from neutral. Instead, they extend racialized policing and reinforce inequality.

The talk wasn’t just about policing. Raul Carillo, for example, explained how financial systems are also a form of surveillance. Every time we swipe a card, banks and corporations not only extract a fee but also gather data about us, data that is later fed into ranking systems that shape our access to loans and even jobs. What feels like convenience for most of us masks a deeper form of control.

Where and Why
---
This conversation focused on the social struggles of normal daily life and how data collection and surveillance are present in nearly every aspect of life. Governments and corporations are investing heavily in data-driven technologies, yet the communities most affected rarely have a say, and sometimes aren’t even informed when new policies or systems are introduced.

As the panelists pointed out, there’s no solid evidence that surveillance technology actually stops violence. ShotSpotter, for example, can dispatch police quickly, but it doesn’t reduce crime. Instead, it reinforces systems of misinformation and harm, while diverting resources away from addressing root causes like housing, healthcare, and education.

How and So what
---
The speakers proposed some alternatives, though mostly as ideas rather than concrete actions. These included defunding police surveillance programs, building public fintech systems, reviving community currencies, and promoting greater data literacy so people can better understand how digital systems shape their opportunities.

For me, it’s a mix of contradictions. On one hand, I appreciate the convenience of digital payments and how data-driven systems make daily life easier. On the other hand, I’m wary of posting anything online and hadn’t really considered how card networks profit every time I tap my debit card or how that data feeds into invisible socioeconomic scoring systems.

This connects to a broader concept that I came to realize: technology is never neutral. It’s always designed within existing systems of power, whether that’s racial capitalism, imperialism, or corporate monopolies.

Takeways

This panel made me think about how surveillance plays into real-world events. Just this week, at the beginning of October, [ICE raided Chicago apartments](https://time.com/7323334/ice-raid-chicago-pritzker-trump/) under the claim that members of the Tren de Aragua gang were inside. These apartments weren’t only occupied by immigrants, legal or undocumented, but also by U.S. citizens. What the residents had in common was being poor and people of color. That kind of targeting doesn’t happen randomly, this can be traced back to systems fueled by data-driven policing and racialized surveillance.

Raul Carillo also raised the issue of digital IDs on the panel and three years later, we’re seeing it play out. At the end of September, the [UK passed a law making digital IDs mandatory](https://www.news18.com/explainers/explained-uks-mandatory-digital-id-what-it-is-how-it-will-work-and-who-is-exempt-ws-l-9603065.html), with people not being able to work without one. Officially, this is framed as a solution to illegal immigration, but it clearly goes further. The UK is even requiring people to [upload ID photos to access websites](https://cybernews.com/uk/how-to-use-vpn/get-around-uk-age-verification-requirements/), or even [YouTube](https://redact.dev/blog/youtube-id-verification-uk-australia-online-safety-age-assurance-2025), after an AI bot estimates their age based on behavior and viewing history. But what counts as underage behavior? Watching certain videos on YouTube? Following certain creators? These measures don’t protect people or kids as they claim, they only expand surveillance and open new doors for discrimination.

My Question
---
How can communities design and govern their own digital or financial technologies in ways that resist surveillance and racialized capitalism, while still ensuring accessibility and security for everyone?

Cryptocurrency was mentioned as a possible alternative, but even there we face risks: how do we make sure it doesn’t just become another tool overseen or co-opted by governments or big tech companies?

I ask this because the real challenge isn’t only in critiquing existing systems, it’s in building sustainable alternatives. We need technologies that genuinely serve communities without reproducing the same harms we’re trying to escape.
