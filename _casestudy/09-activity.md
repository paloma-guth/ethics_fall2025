Design your AI influences
You are a creative director at a brand. Your team must launch a new Virtual Influencer for a campaign targeting young adults.

1. **Define them:** Name, aesthetic, personality traits.
2. **Ethical:** Identify at least two potential ethical risks your VI might create.
3. **Mitigation Plan:** Propose two actions your brand will take to address these risks     
4. **Debrief:** Would you launch her? Why or why not?
