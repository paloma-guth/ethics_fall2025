### By Paloma and Omar

In this episode, we talked about how digital ownership has changed over the years. From streaming subscriptions and e-books to data collection and algorithmic control, we discuss what it really means to “own” something today. Using data and researches we found as well as personal experience we uncover how convenience often comes at the cost of autonomy, privacy, and true ownership.

Below, you can view one of our data visualizations based on the research data we got, as well as an AI-generated image we asked Google Gemini to create based on the podcast transcript.
