Ethical Frameworks and Characters
---
Hosted by Omar and Paloma (me), this podcast explores ethical framework through different characters, both fictional and real. We pick six characters: Jon Snow, Peter Pan, Hasan Piker, Winnie the Pooh, Netanyahu, and Gerald of Rivia. We then assigned them ethical frameworks that would most fit their personalities like Virtue, Care, Nature, Utilitarianism, Deontology, and Contractarianism, and then talked through whether those frameworks really fit. 

You can listen to the discussion in the video/audio, and if you prefer reading, thereâ€™s a transcript available too.
