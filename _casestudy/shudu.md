Interssectionality

Shudu is an example of "a white man's digital projection of real-life Black womanhood." Her creator, Cameron-James Wilson, admitted he was attempting to solve the problem of "the lack of diversity in the modeling world" by creating an ideal Black woman. This raises profound ethical questions about who has the power to define and commodify marginalized identities in the digital age.

Shudu has been critiqued for profiting from the aesthetic of Black women without contributing to the community or experiencing the social and economic consequences of being a Black woman. This is crucial for your discussion on authenticity and alienation.
