## The Problem of the Female Digital Assistant

This dynamic is exemplified in virtual assistants such as Siri, Alexa, and Cortana, which predominantly use female voices. Companies frequently justify this choice by appealing to user preference for a "warm, gentle, and helpful" (Nass & Brave, 2005). However, the ideological consequence is that users are conditioned to associate compliance, emotional labor, and non-confrontational behavior with femininity. Feminist scholars warn that female-coded assistants reinforce the stereotype of women as “submissive and overly accommodating aides,” organizing user interaction along traditional gendered lines (_Dave & Kushwah_, 2025).

Research further suggests that gendered expectations shape how users respond to machine error. When AI errors occur, users are less forgiving of a male voice, perceiving it as a failure of competence, whereas they are more tolerant of a female voice, linking the error to a "failure of compliance." This mirrors the societal double standard where men are expected to be high-status experts and women are expected to be supportive helpers whose value lies in service rather than skill.

The critique must be extended to the use of "sexed cues" (bodies, faces, voices) in addition to "gendered cues." By binding artificial female gender and sex to AI agents, corporations restrict the possibilities of women’s identity to deceptive, narrow, body/face/voice-centric scripts (_Borau_, 2025). This is a form of digital objectification, limiting women's self-concepts to a programmed script of availability and compliance.
