Ethical Frameworks and Characters
---
Hosted by Omar and Paloma (me), this podcast explores ethical framework through different characters, both fictional and real. We pick six characters: Jon Snow, Peter Pan, Hasan Piker, Winnie the Pooh, Netanyahu, and Gerald of Rivia. We then assigned them ethical frameworks that would most fit their personalities like Virtue, Care, Nature, Utilitarianism, Deontology, and Contractarianism, and then talked through whether those frameworks really fit.

### How the Episodes Work
1. Character Selection & Framework Assignment
2. Random Pairing Discussion
3. Ranking & Reflections

### Random Pairing Rankings (Lowest to Highest Fit):
- Jon Snow & Nature – Duty-focused, not naturally good
- Netanyahu & Contractarianism – Prioritizes national fairness over broader social structure
- Hasan Piker & Utilitarianism – Idealist, more about equity than utility
- Peter Pan & Care – Cares for the Lost Boys, but not perfectly consistent
- Winnie the Pooh & Virtue – Humble, gentle, and honest, very virtuous
- Geralt of Rivia & Duty – The ultimate duty-bound hero
