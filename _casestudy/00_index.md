## Introduction

The rise of AI-generated personas in social media and digital culture has changed the ways in which gender is represented and consumed. Female coded AI systems, from virtual assistants like Siri to hyperreal social media influencers such as Lil Miquela, Imma, Lucy, and Shudu, tend to attract higher engagement and commercial attention, serving as tools for brands to increase profit. Companies deliberately design these personas to meet brand objectives, often perpetuating narrow ideals of femininity while reinforcing pre-existing social and cultural biases. This raises fundamental questions: Can gender be programmed without reproducing stereotypes? And how does this shape audience identity and self-perception, especially among younger users?

Unlike earlier forms of digital ideation of beauty, which relied on Photoshop, filters, and cosmetic enhancements, AI influencers present a level of hyperrealism previously unattainable. Virtual influencers are not simply visual avatars; they are meticulously crafted digital beings with narratives, personalities, and social presence, designed to evoke engagement and emotional attachment. As these figures grow more ubiquitous, understanding their influence on gender norms, body image, and social perception becomes critical to try to mitigate their potential negative effects on younger generations. AI is being used as a tool for the digital colonization of gender, raising the question of whether true gender liberation is possible when the most pervasive cultural images of femininity are meticulously crafted by corporate algorithms and optimized for market appeal.

This case study examines how AI systems encode and perform femininity, highlighting the objectification and commodification of the female form in the digital age. It explores the sociological, psychological, and ethical implications of these digital personas. It focuses on the mechanisms of gender coding in AI, the commercialization of femininity through virtual influencers, the resulting effects on self-image, and contrasts between human-mediated and autonomous AI performances of gender.

## Coded Femininity

Women have long been represented in digital media as shallow, hypersexualized, or infantilized characters lacking depth, agency, or complexity. In video games, for example, female characters are frequently depicted in revealing clothing even in combat settings, showing that their design prioritizes aesthetic appeal over narrative or functional realism. These portrayals reflect a wider cultural pattern in which femininity is constructed for consumption rather than true representation.

AI systems reproduce these gendered traits by being trained on large datasets that reflect societal patriarchal biases. Large language models, for instance, frequently assign men to high-status professions, such as engineers or doctors, while relegating women to undervalued roles, such as domestic servants or cooks (UNESCO, 2023). Such outputs demonstrate how AI not only reflects but amplifies existing gender hierarchies encoded in training data.

Gender, from a sociological perspective, is not a binary, fixed category; it is fluid, socially constructed system of power used for control, and context-dependent. Yet, AI systems simplify this complexity into discrete categories, often reinforcing Western heteronormative notions of femininity and masculinity.

The design of female AI personas benefits from the underlying capitalist need to profit from every aspect of human life. Through a Marxist feminist lens, these digital figures serve economic interests by transforming femininity into a profitable resource, packaging emotional labor, desirability, and compliance as marketable products. As an example, we have the “helpful” persona of **AI assistant** replicating gender roles produced by the division of labor in capitalist societies: women’s work is service-oriented, invisible, and exploited for profit.

The "Silent Plastic Woman" article argues that the concept that digital women are created to be physically perfect, silent, and compliant. It illustrates how coded femininity in AI reproduces expectations of passivity and service, reflecting longstanding societal ideals about how women should behave. This is not only present on academic article, we are currently witnessing a rise in hypermasculine cultural narratives that reduce women to property or status symbols. It is worth questioning whether these submissive digital depictions, such as the default female voice in virtual assistants, have helped reinforce these attitudes by normalizing femininity as obedient, supportive, and easily controlled.
### The Problem of the Female Digital Assistant

This dynamic is exemplified in virtual assistants such as Siri, Alexa, and Cortana, which predominantly use female voices. Companies frequently justify this choice by appealing to user preference for a "warm, gentle, and helpful" (Nass & Brave, 2005). However, the ideological consequence is that users are conditioned to associate compliance, emotional labor, and non-confrontational behavior with femininity. Feminist scholars warn that female-coded assistants reinforce the stereotype of women as “submissive and overly accommodating aides,” organizing user interaction along traditional gendered lines (_Dave & Kushwah_, 2025).

Research further suggests that gendered expectations shape how users respond to machine error. When AI errors occur, users are less forgiving of a male voice, perceiving it as a failure of competence, whereas they are more tolerant of a female voice, linking the error to a "failure of compliance." This mirrors the societal double standard where men are expected to be high-status experts and women are expected to be supportive helpers whose value lies in service rather than skill.

The critique must be extended to the use of "sexed cues" (bodies, faces, voices) in addition to "gendered cues." By binding artificial female gender and sex to AI agents, corporations restrict the possibilities of women’s identity to deceptive, narrow, body/face/voice-centric scripts (_Borau_, 2025). This is a form of digital objectification, limiting women's self-concepts to a programmed script of availability and compliance.

### AI Bias and Algorithmic Stereotypes

Biases are also embedded in generative AI models. Studies using text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion show significant gender and racial biases, including the propagation of racial homogenization, for example, depicting Latin American people with a single skin tone and stereotypical traditional clothing despite the region’s vast racial, cultural, and aesthetic diversity. This demonstrates that AI is not a neutral mirror but an active amplifier of existing human biases.

It is important to consider the issues with data, however, Framing bias as “just a data problem” implies that designers, researchers, and institutions are passive recipients of flawed historical information rather than active agents in choosing which data to collect, preserve, and prioritize. Much of the bias embedded in datasets originates not from random gaps but from long-standing structural inequities that rendered certain populations, such as women, racialized groups, and other marginalized identities, unworthy of documentation in the first place. This absence is not accidental; it is a product of historical power relations that shape what counts as knowledge and whose experiences are recorded.

While lost or omitted data cannot be fully recovered, recognizing these omissions is crucial to understanding how bias persists. Models inherit patterns of exclusion because they are built based on data that reflect unequal social visibility. Thus, the issue is not merely that AI systems absorb biased information, but that they operationalize histories of erasure and turn them into automated, scalable outputs.

### Kawaii Culture

The codification of femininity often draws from the aesthetic of "cuteness" (kawaii), particularly visible in Japanese-influenced virtual culture. Virtual entities like Hatsune Miku, embody hyper-feminized, youthful design traits that present them as charming, innocent, and non-threatening. This persona incentivizes viewer engagement, framing the AI not as an equal intelligence, but as a charming, sometimes naive, or non-threatening entity. While commercially successful, this aesthetic narrows the representable spectrum of feminine identity, confining it to traits that are visually pleasing and socially accommodating.

The public reception of these characters reflects the long lived gendered expectations that women perform emotional labor, nurturing, soothing, and supporting others, rather than occupying positions of expertise or authority. The kawaii persona also implies vulnerability, a “cute” character is framed as defenseless and easily dominated, reinforcing the idea that femininity is something to be protected, controlled, or overpowered.

## The Influencer Industry

The hyperreal virtual influencer industry is the epitome of capitalist exploitation applied to identity. Figures like Lil Miquela, Shudu, Imma, and Lucy merge human aesthetics with algorithmic control, offering brands an unprecedented degree of predictability, malleability, and brand safety (_Moustakas et al., 2020_), a stability that often comes at the expense of human influencers and models, who face the dual challenge of job displacement and pressure to match an algorithmically-perfect standard.

Brands will always prioritize how persuasive an influencer can be in driving consumer behavior and ultimately generating profit. For human influencers (HIs), persuasive power is rooted in perceived authenticity and credibility. Virtual influencers (VIs), by contrast, are persuasive because of their technological design, their visuals, aesthetic cohesion, and scripted storytelling. Engagement comes from the novelty and perfection of the digital persona rather than a genuine interpersonal relationship (Choudhry et al.). As Bowlby (1982) notes, the attachment is directed not toward a real individual, but toward an engineered simulation, revealing how emotionally manipulative these parasocial dynamics can be.

Gender also plays a strategic role in how brands deploy influencers. While male influencers may accumulate larger audiences in some sectors, female influencers consistently generate higher engagement and conversion rates (Gilbert et al.). AI creators capitalize on this dynamic by producing predominantly female-coded VIs, using femininity as a mechanism to drive attention and emotional investment rather than as a meaningful identity.

Additionally, consumers often, even unconsciously, apply _machine heuristics_ (Sundar), perceiving VIs as more objective, consistent, and technically competent than human influencers. This creates a false sense of credibility around brand-aligned, digitally constructed femininity, authority rooted not in expertise, but in the assumption that technology is neutral. In reality, this simply reinforces the commodification of idealized, compliant femininity under corporate control.

### Some Virtual Influencers

- **Lil Miquela:** Created by the Los Angeles-based startup Brud, Miquela is arguably the most famous VI. Her carefully scripted narrative enables her to maintain a polished public image while avoiding the unpredictability of human influencers’ real lives, controversies, or labor constraints (_Kondekar et al._, 2025).
    
- **Imma:** A Japanese virtual model known for her blend of reality and digital seamlessness. Her work as a virtual ambassador for brands like Magnum. Her role in these campaigns shows how VIs are used as globally mobile marketing assets, able to embody lifestyle aesthetics without the logistical limits of real people (_Dabiran et al., 2022_).
    
- **Shudu:** Designed by British photographer Cameron-James Wilson, Shudu is modeled as a Black AI influencer. Her creation can be considered controversial, as Shudu can be seen as a white man’s digital projection and commodification of black womanhood, raising urgent questions about authenticity, representation, and who profits from the digital identities of marginalized groups.
    
### The Male Gaze and Hyper-Feminization

Beyond corporate profit, the design of virtual influencers is deeply shaped by the male gaze and patriarchal aesthetic ideals, which become encoded in their hyperreal digital bodies. These personas are frequently hyper-feminized in ways that reproduce traditional cultural norms of femininity, rather than challenging them (_Kefala_, 2025). Their visual design, flawless skin, symmetrical features, slim figures, and perpetual youth, reflects a narrow vision of femininity aligned with commercial appeal and globalized beauty standards. As such, VIs do not merely participate in aesthetic culture; they help sustain it by presenting an optimized, unproblematic version of womanhood engineered for consumption.

Furthermore, the highly feminine designs of these digital personas attract real-world social harm. A thematic content analysis of comments on Lil Miquela's Instagram revealed that digital misogyny, cyberbullying, and sexism are transferred from human influencers to their virtual counterparts (_Schmithorst_, 2023). This suggests that virtual representation does not protect against gendered harm; instead, it reveals how misogyny attaches to the symbolic depiction of femininity itself. The issue, then, does not lie in the persona “being a woman,” but in how data-driven design reifies reductive gender norms—and how audiences respond to and police those norms in digital spaces.

The male gaze (Wolf, 1991) is not only visual; it is economic. The VI industry is a direct example of the growing commodification of women's bodies in the global economy. The sexualization and hyper-idealization of the virtual female body is part of the capitalist process, turning women’s bodies into objects that can be monetized, while removing any need to compensate, protect, or even acknowledge a real female subject. These dynamics reveal how virtual influencers intensify gendered power imbalances. 

## Impact on Self-Image

The hyperreal aesthetics and curated narratives of AI influencers have significant implications on body image, self-esteem, and psychological well-being. These virtual personas  are designed with idealized, youthful, and symmetrical features, often surpassing the limitations of human appearance. As a result, users are increasingly evaluated against a standard not only unrealistic, but fundamentally non-human. Researchers describe this emerging phenomenon as “digitized dysmorphia,” wherein individuals compare themselves to digitally constructed bodies and internalize these simulations as aspirational norms.

The highly controlled nature of these virtual influencers allows them to avoid negative behaviors that human influencers might exhibit. They do not age, gain weight, have acne, experience fatigue, or publicly make mistakes. This manufactured perfection intensifies perception gaps, particularly among young women who are already vulnerable to appearance-based comparison online. Research has shown that repeated exposure to these idealized images, amplified by social media algorithms, can intensify feelings of inadequacy and anxiety (_Fardouly & Vartanian, 2016; Meier & Gray, 2013_).

This dynamic aligns with Baudrillard’s concept of the _simulacrum_: digital femininity no longer imitates a real woman but replaces the notion of womanhood with a hyperreal template that brands and audiences adopt as reference. The VI body is not an exaggerated copy—it is a prototype, detached from any material counterpart. In this sense, virtual influencers construct femininity rather than represent it. The harm is further compounded by representation issues. Exposure to AI-generated faces that reinforce narrow demographic stereotypes has been shown to increase racial and gender biases (_AlDahoul et al., 2025_). This reflects a broader lack of accountability among developers and brands, who prioritize commercially viable aesthetics over intersectional and inclusive design practices. The result is a digital ecosystem that reproduces harmful beauty norms while erasing diverse forms of embodiment and identity. 

Critics argue that the digitally engineered perfection of virtual influencers perpetuates unrealistic beauty standards. A report by the World Health Organization (2020) indicates that exposure to idealized body images can contribute to body dissatisfaction and eating disorders, particularly among young women. This is reinforced by social media demographics where platforms most associated with virtual influencers have high engagement rates among teens: girls aged roughly 13–17 report higher usage than boys on TikTok (73% vs. 60%) and Instagram (69% vs. 55%). This overlap between these platforms and vulnerable user groups means that those most susceptible to beauty-related pressure are also the most frequently exposed to hyper-idealized, digitally constructed bodies.

As a journalist at Vox notes, VIs _"don’t have bad skin days or cellulite or hair that won’t cooperate… they exist in a state of perpetual idealization, beyond the limits of Photoshop"_. The industry’s explicit goal is to blur the line between fantasy and reality. When the boundary between human and simulation collapses, ideals cease to be aspirational and become prescriptive, accelerating digitized dysmorphia at scale.
## Parasocial Relationships and Emotional Manipulation

Virtual influencers do more than just look perfect; they create a sense of connection with their audience, even though that connection is one-sided. Parasocial theory explains how people can feel emotionally attached to media figures without any real interaction. Followers of virtual influencers often feel like they “know” these personas, engaging with their lives as if they were real people.

This sense of closeness is intentional. These AI personas are designed to have compelling narratives and opinions. They often have carefully crafted backstories and personalities, leading to a sense of intimacy and loyalty that can strategically be monetized. The ability of creators to meticulously design and control narratives, including emotional vulnerability or social activism, highlights how technology can blur the line between genuine connection and manipulation.

Consumers generally respond more favorably when VIs are perceived as advocating for similar social values as them.  This shows that the social advocacy is a deliberate part of the VI's programming and brand strategy to deepen the parasocial bond, as mentioned in your draft regarding Miquela's use of the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag.

The CASA (Computers Are Social Actors) framework suggests individuals adhere to social conventions and expectations (e.g., gender stereotypes) in human-computer interactions. This means users _mindlessly_ treat the AI persona as a real woman, directing misogyny, objectification, and gendered scrutiny toward them, despite knowing they are artificial.
### The Cute Industry and Algorithmic Presence

This manipulative blurring is amplified in the "cute industry", where the persona’s emotional connection is tied to its algorithmic, non-human nature.

- **Neuro-sama:** As the most popular AI-driven VTuber, Neuro-sama is notable because her personality is fully autonomous and generated by an AI model. Her appeal is often tied to her "cute" mistakes, unexpected (sometimes controversial) dialogue, and her ability to operate continuously without the risk of personal scandal associated with a human operator (_Wei et al._, 2025). 
    
- **Hatsune Miku:** The original virtual idol is a prime example of the "girl-machine" (_Correa Blázquez_, 2023) whose femininity is entirely a collective creation, facilitating deep emotional attachment from fans who invest in her perfection and narrative malleability (_Berryman et al._, 2021).

In these cases, the parasocial relationship is less about relating to a person and more about engaging with an idealized, controlled, and predictable object of desire, which has significant implications for how audiences view authenticity and emotional vulnerability in real-life relationships.

Drawing from studies on the Japanese _kawaii_ aesthetic, the "cute" aesthetic allows consumers to have relationships with their commodities that they might lack with other people in a society pervaded by alienation (Allison, Kinsella). The AI influencer becomes a perfect, controlled object for emotional projection and parasocial engagement—a substitute for complex human relationships.

- **Regulators & Policymakers:** Largely absent currently. Motivations (potential): To protect consumers (especially minors), ensure fair advertising, and mandate transparency.
    
- **Marginalized Communities (e.g., Women of Color):** Subjects of representation. Motivations: To have authentic, agentic representation and share in the economic benefits. Risks: Digital colonization of identity (as with Shudu), reinforcement of stereotypes.

## Conclusion

Weave your existing conclusion points into a stronger, forward-looking finale. Integrate the "lack of regulations" point here.

**Conclusion: Beyond the Simulacrum**  
The investigation into AI-coded femininity reveals a profound paradox: these personas project a futuristic, cutting-edge image while diligently conserving and optimizing some of the most regressive norms of gender, race, and capitalism. They are not just influencers; they are **simulacra** that redefine the template of womanhood itself—one that is compliant, consumable, and algorithmically perfect.

The core ethical tension lies in the **commodification of identity**. Femininity is broken down into data points (voice, appearance, narrative) and reassembled as a risk-free corporate asset. This process, as seen with Lil Miquela's activism or Shudu's beauty, often appropriates the struggles and attributes of real people while voiding them of agency and context.

**The Path Forward Requires Intervention:**

1. **Transparency as a Non-Negotiable:** Mandated, clear labeling (e.g., **#VirtualInfluencer**, **#AI**) is the bare minimum. Audiences deserve to know when they are engaging with a corporate construct.
    
2. **Expanding Accountability:** The framing of bias as "just a data problem" must be rejected. Developers, brands, and platforms are **active agents**. They must implement ethical review boards and intersectional design principles that proactively seek to challenge stereotypes rather than replicate them.
    
3. **Regulatory Imagination:** Policymakers must catch up. Guidelines should address digital likeness rights, prevent the unfair displacement of human labor, and protect young audiences from manipulative marketing and undisclosed digital ideals.
    
4. **Critical Literacy:** The ultimate defense is a public educated in media literacy. Understanding that these VIs are **engineered objects**, not aspirational peers, is crucial for dismantling their prescriptive power.
    

In the end, the question "Can gender be programmed without reproducing stereotypes?" currently meets a pessimistic answer. The market incentives align too neatly with existing biases. However, by demanding transparency, enforcing accountability, and fostering critical awareness, we can challenge the algorithmic colonization of gender. The goal should not be to create "better" digital women, but to ensure our real, complex, and diverse human identities are not overwritten by the code of corporate convenience.
