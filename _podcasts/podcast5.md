### By Paloma and Omar

In this episode, we discussed how memes function as cultural texts (and context) that we read, interpret, and remix. We explore how memes rely on shared knowledge, tone, and context, and how these habits of interpretation spill over into how we read other media in our everyday lives.

We discuss how memes aren’t just jokes but communication systems that depend on community understanding. This led us to reflect on whether the quick, intuitive ways we read memes change how we engage with information offline, including news, classroom content, and social interactions.
