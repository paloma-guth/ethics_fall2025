This site brings together my projects, reflections, and work from this course (CSCI 263).


About Me
---
My name is Paloma. I’m a Computer Science and Mathematics student in the [Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science Department](https://wp.stolaf.edu/mscs/) at St. Olaf College. I'm earning my B.A in Computer Science and Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics & Data Science. 

Research 
---
Throughout my years at college, I’ve worked on several projects in data collection and cleaning using R and Python. I also contributed to a machine learning project for image generation with CUDA [Graffiti Generator](https://medium.com/@mhollis_2953/graffiti-generator-d832258e1a2c). More recently, I spent the summer working on a project in Python and Julia focused on data collection, cleaning, and statistical analysis (GitHub link when the statistical analysis in Julia is complete). My interests for future researches are in machine learning but more focused on the backend side, such as optimization, data pipelines, and data engineering.

As for topics in Ethics I’m interested in the broader implications of generative AI, like why and how access is made available to the general public, and what kinds of economic or social effects that might create. I would also like to learn more about the environmental impact of data centers and the trade-offs involved in supporting such large-scale systems.

Personal Life
---
I’m originally from Brazil and have had the chance to live in four countries so far: Brazil, the Netherlands (at UWC Maastricht), the United States (at St. Olaf College), and Denmark. Outside of academics, I’m an older sister and a cat owner (I have a chunky gray cat called Elliot). I love reading fantasy and playing RPGs, both tabletop like Dungeons & Dragons and video games. I’m also into puzzle games and cozy games like Stardew Valley.  Cooking is another hobby of mine as I especially enjoy trying out Asian recipes, even if the results, frequently, doesn't turn out as expected.
