**Truth in the Crossfire**<br>
How misinformation and censorship shape what we see and believe online

**Case study:**
[Censorship of Misinformation and Freedom of Speech on Social Media](https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/pub/lkf63cu5/release/1)

Introduction
---
The internet was supposed to make information free and accessible, but somewhere along the way, it also made misinformation impossible to escape. We live in a time where truth and lies spread at the same speed, where algorithms decide what we see, and where people can build entire communities around conspiracy theories.

The article discusses how misinformation today seems worse than in the past and questions whether it’s truly more dangerous now or if we’re just more aware of it. It also raises difficult questions about censorship, truth, and how much we can really know on our own.

### Misinformation: past and present

Misinformation has always been around, we can look at the moon landing stuff, the communist hunts, yellow journalism, so maybe it just feels worse now because we see it everywhere. But I do think it’s worse today, not just because people lie more, but because of how easily harmful rhetoric spreads.

Before, someone with delusional or hateful ideas would stay isolated. Now they can find each other online even if oceans apart, on 4chan, Discord, whatever. They build entire communities around delusions. Misinformation isn’t just lying; it’s twisting bits of truth to build a story that serves a group or agenda.

We can see the harms of misinformation clearly in the incel movement. They’ve built an entire online culture out of false ideas about women and gender. There are so many stories of young men falling into that trap, only to realize years later how much they’d been fed lies. There is also fake news in politics, which has been used forever, sure, but social media made it stronger because now we live in our own bubbles. Back then, everyone watched the same TV channels; now, algorithms feed us only what we already agree with. That’s why people are shocked when their candidate loses, in their world, everyone voted the same.

And AI is making it worse. Once you see something, a visual proof, it becomes real to you, even when it’s not. That’s terrifying. So yes, I think misinformation today is worse, not because there’s more of it, but because its purpose has changed. It’s not just about making people agree with government decisions or scapegoating “the other.” It’s now being used to make us hate each other, so we won’t look up and see the real problem.

### Justified censorship

This is something I keep going back and forth on. I do not like the idea of censorship. It feels wrong, like giving too much power to whoever’s in charge. But at the same time, a totally free internet doesn’t work. We’ve tried it. We’ve seen what happens. Another thing is that we already give away our data to these tech oligarchs without even knowing what’s being done with it. The only difference is that it’s not the government holding it, but companies that don’t have to obey as many rules, which, honestly, feels even worse.

Censorship has become this big, scary word. I don’t know when it started being used this way, but it seems to have become especially common when people talk about countries that don’t fit the Western idea of democracy. Well, I have something to say to the so-called free world: your internet is more censored than many of the places you call non-democratic. Why do I have to pay for everything just to get access? Why can’t I share with my friends? Why do I get totally different results on Google compared to an independent search engine like DuckDuckGo? This kind of veiled censorship is even worse because you don’t even realize you’re being censored.

Censorship can make people trust even less, and that’s already one of the main roots of misinformation. But there are things that I think should be censored. Like the child exploitation stuff that’s been happening in Brazil, the whole [“adultization” of minors for fame](https://en.mercopress.com/2025/08/28/brazil-s-senate-passes-bill-against-adultification-of-children-online). That shouldn’t even exist online. Governments need to draw a line somewhere. Governments need to draw a line somewhere. Of course, censorship can go wrong fast; a conservative government could use it to block so much information, such as birth control or women’s rights. But maybe it’s a risk we have to take. People will always find ways around bans if they really want to.

One example I actually agree with, that can be classified as censorship, is [China’s recent rule about influencers needing degrees to talk about topics like health or law](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/china-stuns-the-internet-influencers-must-now-show-degrees-to-talk-about-health-law-or-finance/ar-AA1PCtV0). That might seem restrictive, but it helps stop misinformation at its source. It doesn’t limit access to information, only who can spread it. The idea is that the information people do find is as accurate as possible within the circumstances. It’s not perfect, but it’s something.

### What can you know by yourself?

Honestly, nothing. Knowledge is social, it depends on other people, institutions, and trust. Even who you are and what you think are shaped by your environment.

Everything I know comes from somewhere: my parents, the school I went to, what I watched growing up, what I was allowed to see or question. My ideas aren’t fully mine, they’re built from the culture and society I was raised in. Even when I say “I did my own research,” what I’m really doing is reading someone else’s research, trusting someone else’s data, or watching someone else explain it to me.

Even the stuff that feels objective, like math or physics, depends on other people’s work. Math proofs are made by humans, and humans make mistakes. What we accept as “true” is true only until someone with better tools or more computing power proves otherwise. That’s not a bad thing, it’s how we move forward. But it does show how little we can actually know on our own.

We like to think that knowledge is about discovering something new, but it’s really about trusting the right people. Our entire understanding of the world is built on layers of other people’s work, beliefs, and interpretations. We’re not meant to know everything or anything by ourselves, as social beings we’re meant to build on each other.

### Avoid falling for misinformation

- **Check who’s talking:** Don’t just focus on what they’re saying, look at who they are. Everyone has bias. Check their history, what they’ve said before, and what kind of agenda they might have.

- **Trust experts, not influencers:** Expertise matters. If a geologist says a landslide is coming, we don’t argue, we move. The same goes for scientists and doctors. The internet made everyone think they’re an expert, but that’s exactly why misinformation spreads.

- **Look for context**: Online content is often chopped into short clips or quotes. A single sentence taken out of context can completely flip a meaning. Always look for the full version before forming an opinion.

- **Diversify what you read and watch:** Social media builds bubbles where we only see what we already agree with. Try to follow people who think differently from you — not to argue, but to understand the bigger picture. 

New Discussion Question
---
**Question:** How do we draw the line between “protecting” people from misinformation and controlling what people are allowed to know?

I came up with this question because both misinformation and censorship deal with power, who holds it, and who decides what’s true. The question made me think about how blurry that line is. If we support censorship to stop harm, how do we stop it from becoming control? I have been battling about the idea of censorship and freedom of speech for quite some time now and I cannot find a defining line that favors one over the other. 

Reflection
---
This article and the questions made me realize that everything exists on a gray scale, nothing is ever completely good or completely bad. I really don’t like the idea of censorship, especially the thought that I might need to upload my ID just to create a social media account in the near future. But at the same time, I understand why it might be necessary.

I like being anonymous online, but people have abused that privilege. What used to be a space for freedom has turned into a space where some feel entitled to be hateful or even commit hate crimes under the excuse that the internet has no rules. They forget that we all live in societies and are still citizens of a country, meaning, those rules do apply to us, even online.

Misinformation has always been a problem, but now it has the power to harm so many more people at once. The internet made information global, but it also made lies global. I don’t have an answer for how to stop it or even how to control it. What I do know is that full censorship isn’t the solution, but total free speech, like what’s happening on X, is even worse.
