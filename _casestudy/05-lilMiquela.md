Lil Miquela, who was created by the company Brud and has over 3 million followers on Instagram, has collaborated with brands like Calvin Klein and Prada. She was reportedly earning over $10,000 per sponsored post in 2021, collaborating with high-profile brands such as Calvin Klein, Prada, and Chanel.

Lil Miquela's Manufactured Persona: Miquela's creators deliberately "scripted Miquela’s life like a TV show." This includes her music career, her political views (e.g., #BlackLivesMatter), and even her manufactured friendships with other VIs. This supports your point about the curated, manipulative nature of their narratives.

Manipulation of Intimacy: The strategy is to "cultivate genuine, emotional connection" by fabricating relatable struggles, but the true purpose is always to "increase brand awareness and profitability." This perfectly encapsulates the manipulation inherent in parasocial relationships with AI.
